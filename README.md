# Minecraft Server Exploits

Keep in mind at the moment I am working on finding minecraft server exploits there are currently none in the git repo, technicly this works as a boilerplate for a minecraft server so if you wanted to; all you would have to do is run start.sh if you wanted to start a minecraft server.
